            "Pool Cleaning Simulator is a PowerWash Simulator-esque cleaning
            game where you use a variety of tools to make filthy pools sparkling
            clean." The game recreates the entire process of cleaning,
            scrubbing, and maintaining various pools, from luxurious backyard
            havens to community swimming complexes.

            Why are these games so much fun? I hate cleaning in real life! This
            pool cleaning sim is still in early access, but it has definite
            potential. I liked that it had a story to each job, and dipping into
            murder and choices of how we complete a job was a nice touch. The
            music and graphics are better than expected, and the jobs have a ton
            of variety with things hidden around the area. The puzzles to work
            with the pools are fun, and there are hidden extra objectives and
            puzzles on each job. It does need some fixing though. The UV light
            stumped me till I looked it up and learned we carry it, tho the
            graphic is not for a handheld light. I did not like going underwater
            to work with the vacuum, and I didn’t have dirt down there to clean.
            The poor movement and the water just over my head was too unpleasant
            so that’s as far as I got. This is going to be an issue for people
            with worse sensory issues than me. I hope they’re able to overcome
            the glitches because I’m looking forward to playing more. Maybe for
            now a way to skip an incomplete job if we cannot complete it would
            be nice. This is a must for your cleaning sim collections.

            Start your own cult in a land of false prophets, venturing out into
            diverse and mysterious regions to build a loyal community of
            woodland Followers and spread your Word to become the one true cult.

            The game is fantastic. Viewers had a good time joining and voting,
            but I think it'd be fun without the twitch interaction. Took over 15
            min to kill my cult in the end with the deadly dish, but was very
            satisfying lol. Then I changed my mind and regretted my save, and
            I'd get new people real quick but they'd go eat the leftover poison!
            Was a blast. Art and music were perfect, and the characters were
            loveable. Wish we could earn something to keep people alive, though.

            I don’t give positive reviews just for getting a free game. I also
            think I should play the full game before giving a review. Full
            disclosure, I have not played the full game, but lemme tell you bout
            it, okay? The game surpassed expectation. The story is funny, the
            graphics are amazing, and the puzzles are clever and fun. I
            requested this game before a pretty bad night, and was super excited
            to play it. I spent an hour enjoying but struggling with it on
            stream before finally giving up and crying and switching games over
            completely unrelated stuff. I feel I cheated the dev out of a good
            showcase during the sale, and I’m sorry. I know my community will
            love it, and several people I saw already wishlisted it. I don’t
            know when I’m going to be able to get back to it, and I wanted to do
            whatever I could do boost the game while dealing with some bad IRL
            stuff. I guess it was too soothing and meditative to distract me
            from my dramatic issues at the time. I don’t think there’s another
            game out there like this. They are puzzles, but they also allow us
            to be artistic. There’s comedy in the narration. The music is
            incredibly soothing. I’ll update the review when I finish it, but I
            wanted to encourage everyone to try this game even with an hour of
            playtime.
