      <p>!sfx for a list of alerts, scarier ones are sub only

!quote add, !quote, !fact (for a random interesting fact!), !ethics, !uplay, !switch, !steam

Subscriber Commands:
!no, !burn, !scary, !laugh1, !goofy, !scream1, !scream2, !ermey, !chaos, !saber, !iseeyou, !chain, !space, !growly, !exterminate, !snarl, !dance, !mercy, !cat, !zombie, !newt, !tequila, !sacred, !scratch

Subs get their own sounds!

Follower sound alert cooldowns are 60 min, Sub sounds are 30 min. Except Rex, and she knows why! If you spam the alerts, they don't scare me!

All bits get an alert, but bits 5-100 are one scare alert, one for 101-500, and 500+</p>
