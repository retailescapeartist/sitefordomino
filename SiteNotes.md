<!-- What needs to be worked on?
    1. The data for the GameLibrary Page need to be cleaned up. There's lots of unneeded stuff.
    2. Data cleanup has been moved to another date.
    3. the movies and music lists do need some sort of content.
    4. I still haven't figured out what to do with the clip of the week content.
       1. I decided on YouTube,TwitchTV-cards, and Movie trailers.
       2. Need to stylize the twitch card content.
    5. Button for Twitch clip or Title cards?
    6. Fix the movie suggestions player. It isn't lining up properly.
   Everything else seems to be looking good so far.
   Goal is to have the whole site done with by 12/11/2023 at the latest.
