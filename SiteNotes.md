<!-- What to work on -->
<!-- Theme was updated, and color of text needs to be updated -->
<!-- Instead of buttons for Twitch Clips, copy the card layout from artShowcase -->
<!-- Clips & Playlist page needs to be fixed on mobile -->
<!-- Add a hamburger menu? possibly? -->
<!-- Make Clips section, Twitch section, and Movie sections a carrousel of clips. -->
<!-- Don't have a lot of space to work with for a better layout -->
<!-- Layout ideas:
    1. copy the grid layout from art page
    2. make slideshow cards
    3. make cards that popup
 -->
<!-- Fix the links on the art page -->
